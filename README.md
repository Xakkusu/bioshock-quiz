# Bioschok Quiz

You think you know your game, then let's proof it!

The Bioshock Quiz is a fun little game that quizzes the user about their Bioshock knowdledge. Hence this quiz is for people who played at least one game out of the series and want to test themselves on what they picked up from it. The goal is to answer as many questions correctly as possible. 

The Bioshock games have captivated millions of players all around the world. Yet they are dried out of new content. What better way is there to spend the time waiting for new game, than to refresh everything you know about the series and proof that you are worthy for new content. 

As many people that have become tired of waiting for Judas or a new Bioshock games and replaying the old games yearly, I wanted to pay my respect to my favourite video game (Bioshock II) and its series. This quiz is also a fun thing to use when spending time with friends, from which everyone thinks they know the most about this game.
